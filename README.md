# MachineLearning
The idea is build different kind of machine learning models up in a object oriented manner. The main branch should be able to call each independent trained model as an object for furture usage.
Further, learning ressources will be made available for each model from lectures I've had in applied Machine learning, provided by, Christian MÃ¸ller Dahl: https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/christian-m%C3%B8ller-dahl

Will contain a demonstration of the following model types:
- Fully connected neural network.
- Convulutional neural network
- Recurrent neural network.
- Autoencoder.
- Variational Auto Encoder.
- Generative adversatial neural network
